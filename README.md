# superbox's neuro link containment cell (click them)

site for hosting aggregated list of personally maintained neuro-sama related projects & websites in a simple card layout

## TODO

- Eliv dark theme
- Make grid entries for each site will redirect on 1st click

## Most recent changes

- previous dynamic open button repurposed to neurosama discord invite link.
- colorscheme updates:
  - neuro themed for light
  - evil neuro for dark
  (very groundbreaking stuff)
- bottom footer properly anchors to bottom of page now
- Python helper for myself to mass edit entriesbut likely to be removed or unused in final

## Status

- Static page which loads static JSON data and displays it in a card layout
- defeated the helper menace
